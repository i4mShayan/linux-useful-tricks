## Purpose Of This Repo
After a few years of working with Linux systems I found out even though Linux has a huge community, still there is no solid solution for some common problems like internet connection which may bother some newbies and even some pros!

So I decided to make kinda a document to help this community feel more home on their linux desktops/servers!

**Hope you enjoy it!**
